SNR Star Tool v1.0
【Principle】
・Signal variance (σ_s²) is calculated as the covariance between two observation images acquired under identical conditions
・Noise variance (σ_n²) is calculated as half the variance of the difference image between the two observation images
・SNR* is defined by the following equation: SNR* = 10 log10 (σ_s² / σ_n²)
【Usage】
1. Prepare two observation images acquired under identical imaging conditions and store them in a single folder.
2. Launch the ImageJ SNR star Tool and select the folder from step 1.
3. Draw an ROI over the SNR measurement region on the opened image and proceed to the next step.
4. SNR*, measurement region, signal variance value, and noise variance value will be outputed.
